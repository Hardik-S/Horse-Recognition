# Horse-Recognition

Machine Learning Algorithm to differentiate between data set containing Arabian horses, Mustangs, and Unicorns. Useful for determining whether or not to squish a cute stuffed toy looking thing.

Utilizes similar concepts to 3 & 7 program with image recognition. Utilizes widgets produced by Jeremy Howard's team. Carbon-copy of the DuckDuckGO program modified for horses.

To use yourself, please upload the .txt files containing duck URLs to colab/ jupyter and drag to a folder named horses. The program automatically creates it the first run through if you forget. Should achieve >80% accuracy following second round of fitting.
